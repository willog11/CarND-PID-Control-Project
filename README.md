# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Introduction

The purpose of the project was to implement a PID (Proportional, Integral and Differential) controller and tune it so that the vehicle drives safely around the track. The simulator provides cross-track error (CTE), speed and steering angle data to help provide this functionality.

## Rubric Tasks

### Describe the PID components

The Proportional component controls how much the vehicle will respond to the CTE. If this value is too high then the vehicle will oscillate uncontrollably but if its too low then the vehicle will never converge to a CTE of 0.

The Differential component counteracts the effects of P components to oscillate and overshoot. It should be tuned to allow for smooth driving. If its set too low then the vehicle will overshoot for a while. If its too high it will take a long time to converge to a CTE of 0.

The Integral component counteracts biases in the system. In real world driving scenarios this would be caused by the alignment of the wheels for example. In the case of this project, it helps reduce the impact of the majority of the course having left hand turns.

### How were the PID coefficients parameterized

The process for parameterisation was straight forward:

1. First the parameters were selected manually to give an OK performance when the throttle was fixed.
2. Once a decent set were found which allowed for the vehicle to drive around the track a PID was created to control the speed. A max speed was decided upon to ensure the vehicle would never drive off the track. Point 1 was then repeated for the speed PID
3. A Twiddle algorithm was implemented to control each co-efficient on seperate runs. This was to allow for only one variable and the rest of the coefficents to be controlled.
4. Finally the parameters were tweaked manually to try and improve any weak areas. This also allowed to get a more hands on approach and in return understand more from the PID controller.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
